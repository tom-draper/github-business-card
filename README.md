# GitHub Business Card

A fun website to generate a digital GitHub business card incorporating account features and stats. It requests data through GitHub's free REST API, which limits an IP address to 600 requests per hour. If the generation fails, you may have exceeded this limit and could retry again in an hour.

Inspired by <a href="https://crd.so/">scastiel's GitHub business card<a>.
